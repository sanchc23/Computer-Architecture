# Computer-Architecture
Projects for ECE 552: Introduction to Computer Architecture at UW-Madison

The class consisted of one large project, split into multiple phases.

In phase 1, we implemented a simple single-stage processor with 16 possible operations.

In phase 2, we converted the processor into a 5-stage one.

In phase 3, we added a cache hierarchy, and changed various components for proficiency.

Taken in the Fall of 2020.
